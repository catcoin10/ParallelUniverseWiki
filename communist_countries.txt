Eight Communist Countries

There are eight communist countries, five of which are in whole or in part in Asia: Cuba, China (whose communist status is doubtful though it regularly trades with other communist countries and sometimes the United States), Laos, North Korea, North Sudan (also known as Bir Tawil), the Soviet Union, and Rwanda.

All communist countries except for North Korea have internet access for the general public. Rwanda has the slowest internet speed of 320 kbps that can sometimes get cut to 160 or 120 in high usage due to the relatively slow population and only being able to pay for a 200 gigabit connection Cuba, North Sudan, and Rwanda get internet

All countries allow restricted tourism and most allow immigration despite the fact that Rwanda is somewhat unstable and is not always open due to CIA backed rebel forces that came in since the second Hutu rebellion in 1997, roughly thirty years later
